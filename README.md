# 👁️ VeriFace: A Facial Recognition Attendance System

## 🧠 About the Project

**VeriFace** is an intelligent facial recognition-based attendance system developed as my Capstone Project. The goal is to automate the attendance process using real-time face detection and recognition, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency over traditional methods like roll calls or manual registers.

This system is built using Python and leverages machine learning techniques to recognize faces, track attendance, and store the results securely. It’s a fast, contactless, and scalable solution suitable for institutions and workplaces.
